      <h2>Number Theory I</h2>
      <p class="bio">
  Number Theory I introduces the fundamental concepts and results regarding the integers. 
  The course begins with the study of divisibility, covering the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the Division Algorithm, prime numbers, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, along with essential arithmetic functions like Euler's phi function and the Möbius inversion formula.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  A major focus is the theory of congruences, including modular arithmetic, linear Diophantine equations, and the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 
  We also study classical results such as the theorems of Fermat, Euler, and Wilson, which provide the theoretical basis for modern applications in cryptography.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  The final part of the course explores quadratic residues and the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, using Legendre and Jacobi symbols. 
  Additional topics include the method of infinite descent, sums of squares, Pythagorean triples, and a brief introduction to elliptic curves.

      <h4><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Notes</h4>
      <p>
        These are informal working notes for Number Theory I. They are not organized by topic or by semester and should not be regarded as a fully planned or polished course manuscript. 
  However, some of the examples and exercises developed throughout the notes may still be useful as complementary material for students.
  For this reason, they are made available here with these caveats in mind.

      <p>
 As with the notes, this section contains a compilation of various homework assignments and problem sets. 
  Although they do not follow a unified structure, they may serve as valuable practice material for anyone who wishes to reinforce their understanding of the topics covered in the course.
