      <h2>Advanced Algebra II</h2>
      <p class="bio">
  Advanced Algebra II continues the structural approach to mathematics by focusing on three fundamental algebraic systems: the integers, complex numbers, and polynomials. 
  [cite_start]The course begins with a deep dive into the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$, covering the division algorithm, the Euclidean algorithm, prime numbers, unique factorization, and the theory of congruences (modular arithmetic)[cite: 338].
</p>

<p class="bio">
  We then transition to the construction and properties of the field of complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. 
  [cite_start]Students explore their geometric representation, polar form, and key results such as De Moivre’s theorem and the extraction of $n$-th roots[cite: 338].
</p>

<p class="bio">
  The final section of the course generalizes arithmetic concepts to the ring of polynomials over a field. 
  [cite_start]We study divisibility, reducibility, and factorization of polynomials, culminating in the proof and applications of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which asserts that every non-constant polynomial has a root in $\mathbb{C}$[cite: 338, 347].
