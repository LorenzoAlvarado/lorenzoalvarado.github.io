      <h2>Advanced Algebra I</h2>
      <p class="bio">
  Advanced Algebra I serves as the foundational course for the mathematics curriculum, introducing the rigorous language and logical structures used throughout higher mathematics. 
  The course begins with Set Theory and the formal definition of functions and relations, providing the essential vocabulary for all subsequent mathematical study.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  A central component of the course is the study of the natural numbers and the Principle of Mathematical Induction, a fundamental tool for rigorous proofs. 
  We also explore combinatorial analysis, including permutations, combinations, and the Binomial Theorem, establishing a strong background in discrete mathematics.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  The final part of the course introduces the core concepts of Linear Algebra within the context of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
  Students learn about vector spaces, subspaces, linear independence, and bases, as well as the theory of matrices, determinants, and methods for solving systems of linear equations.
