      <h2>Calculus I — Single-Variable Differential Calculus</h2>
      <p class="bio">
  Calculus I is the first course in the calculus sequence of the School of Sciences and serves as an introduction to the language, methods, and formal reasoning of higher mathematics. 
  The course develops the foundations of single-variable differential calculus, starting from the structure of the real numbers and progressing through functions, limits, continuity, and differentiation, with constant emphasis on modeling phenomena involving change.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  In particular, during the initial section on real numbers, I place special emphasis on understanding basic operations from a rigorous perspective. 
  In many elementary treatments, technical details are often skipped for the sake of speed, especially when manipulating formulas or using basic operations. 
  For this reason, the course begins with a careful discussion of fundamental concepts such as the square root function and the absolute value, ensuring that these notions are properly understood both algebraically and geometrically.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  Throughout the course, intuitive ideas are always accompanied by concrete examples and geometric interpretations. 
  This approach aims to bridge formal definitions—such as limits and derivatives—with their intuitive meaning, allowing students to develop both technical proficiency and conceptual understanding.

      <h4><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Notes</h4>
      <p>
        These are informal working notes for Calculus I. They are not organized by topic or by semester and should not be regarded as a fully planned or polished course manuscript. 
  However, some of the examples and exercises developed throughout the notes may still be useful as complementary material for students.
  For this reason, they are made available here with these caveats in mind.

 As with the notes, this section contains a compilation of various homework assignments and problem sets. 
  Although they do not follow a unified structure, they may serve as valuable practice material for anyone who wishes to reinforce their understanding of the topics covered in the course.
