      <h2>Calculus IV — Multivariable Integral Calculus</h2>
      <p class="bio">
  Calculus IV completes the introductory calculus sequence by extending the theory of integration to higher dimensions. 
  The course starts with multiple integrals (double and triple), covering Fubini’s theorem, the change of variables formula (including polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates), and applications to volume and mass.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  We then transition to vector calculus, introducing line and surface integrals for both scalar functions and vector fields. 
  Key concepts such as work, conservative fields, potential functions, and flux across surfaces are developed in detail to prepare for the fundamental theorems of the subject.
</p>

<p class="bio">
  The course culminates with the three major integral theorems: Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence (Gauss) Theorem. 
  These results relate integrals over a region to integrals over its boundary, providing a powerful generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to multidimensional space.

      <h4><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Notes</h4>
      <p>
        These are informal working notes for Calculus IV. They are not organized by topic or by semester and should not be regarded as a fully planned or polished course manuscript. 
  However, some of the examples and exercises developed throughout the notes may still be useful as complementary material for students.
  For this reason, they are made available here with these caveats in mind.

      <p>
 As with the notes, this section contains a compilation of various homework assignments and problem sets. 
  Although they do not follow a unified structure, they may serve as valuable practice material for anyone who wishes to reinforce their understanding of the topics covered in the course.
